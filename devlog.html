next: stand when not moving



later:

get ground textured
camera at a better angle
maybe just a spot light somewhere
fireflies/fire/some lighting
ooo myabe some stars
trees?
resize canvas on window resize https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-responsive.html

lets see if we can make her stand when she's not moving and also turn in the direction she's walking


# 6/22

ok lets see if i can click to move

hell yeha got the raycaster working

ok now i need to make her walk there.
i think first i'll teleport her
then do interpolation
then get it so that she idles when she's not moving, and does the walking anim when she is
and then maybe refactor the Person class to do this nicely using anim tags from aseprite

so the built in three js vector3 lerp has a param that is like the percentage between the origin and the target... i dont think thats super useful to me bc i want the walk speed to be the same, no matter the distance

what i want is like the direction between current location and target
and then every frame move greta <walkSpeed> in that direction
yeah ane maybe there can be some acceleration at the beginning and end if i'm fancy but nahhhh

i got some cool vibrating glitch effects that i'd love to try to do on purpose later. but it basically works! still dont have her idling when she's not moving, but im gonna eat lunch

getting this ground textured is turning out to be harder than i thought and i'm tired of it so i'm going to try to do something else next. i want to be able to click somewhere, and the character will walk there. like runescape

ok the lots-of-little-planes was too slow. i guess there might still be a way to make it work... if we preload it? or look into why its so slow to create the geometries. or just figure out a way to wait on the load without making the browser totally unresponsive

but i kind of want to try doing it in shaders anyway. going to be using ShaderMaterial and this threejsfundamentals article: https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-shadertoy

i'm looking at one of the examples from the ShaderMaterial docs and realizing that it would be nice to just be able to click and drag to rotate the cam. i'm going to try to add that quickly. maybe its using a lib or something

well that took a lot more work than i thought it would. turns out es6/typescript requires modules to be made ready for it or something

i think i'll get a GUI for some sliders while i'm at it

# 6/15

going to do walking animation now

got the ground plane working woo

now i want to make it like a pixelated texture to signify grass

maybe a render target?
https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-rendertargets.html

but using shadermaterial is probably the more performant/correct way, i'll try that first
https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-shadertoy.html

in the shower i thought of an idea of just using a ton of tiny planes. i wonder if this would work and not make things crash etc.

one thing i could do is to handraw the pixel texture, but actually i want to procgen it. i think that's important

i tried the tons of tiny planes and it's too slow!!! no! but also woo!!! exilirating. i guess it's time to try the GPU shader method next

omg there's a threejsfundamentals hahaha
https://threejsfundamentals.org/

i dont think i'm going to pour over this and go step-by-step like i did for webgl. but there is this article on transparency that i stumbled upon that i think will help
https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-transparency.html

i dont think i want directional lighting, or at least not that realistic effect that i'm getting from this phong material. i think i do want flat lighting. but i also want to get some effect from point lights
maybe the demo i should strive for is:
a character or two walking around
the ground has that pixel texture
pixelart/dynamic lighting fire ... and/or pixelart/dynamic lighting fireflies and/or pixelart/dynamic lighting lampposts
these are all different lights moods. or are they?

well i did the thing anyway where i read through the threejsfundamentals intro. i did learn a couple things, like that you can pass a canvas into WebGLRenderer which is nice

i got the plane to be transparent, which is sick. next i should animate the walk cycle, or start getting a ground in.

<p> i am very hungover. this is my first devlog on this project, which i started about a month ago. the first 2-3 weeks were really just me learning webgl and then i took a week break. i've been cleaning my appt. at the same time which i think has been informing my design interests a little.</p>

<p> i've gotten to a point where i'm realizing writing all the low level webgl stuff myself in vanilla js is maybe needlessly sadistic. i finally got a perspective view working, but my sprite is flipped upside down, and i know it has something to do with a quirk of the matrix math but i dont really care anymore.</p>

<p> i was kind of expecting to hit this point. i wish i got a little further, like implementing basic lighting and procgen textures. and i'm still not sure if i can get the visual effect that i want with using an engine/library. but if i can, it would probably make the process more enjoyable. so that's what i'm going to do now: explore some tools
<p> <a href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-2d-vs-3d-library.html">this post</a> from webglfundamentals makes me think i should use threes.js</p>

<p>yeah looks like three.js is the ticket. going to try to do what i want to do with threejs now. i'm a little worried that it wont let me do weird shader stuff... but im sure it has support for that right?</p>
