omg there's a threejsfundamentals hahaha
https://threejsfundamentals.org/

i dont think i'm going to pour over this and go step-by-step like i did for webgl. but there is this article on transparency that i stumbled upon that i think will help
https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-transparency.html

i dont think i want directional lighting, or at least not that realistic effect that i'm getting from this phong material. i think i do want flat lighting. but i also want to get some effect from point lights
maybe the demo i should strive for is:
a character or two walking around
the ground has that pixel texture
pixelart/dynamic lighting fire ... and/or pixelart/dynamic lighting fireflies and/or pixelart/dynamic lighting lampposts
these are all different lights moods. or are they?

well i did the thing anyway where i read through the threejsfundamentals intro. i did learn a couple things, like that you can pass a canvas into WebGLRenderer which is nice

i got the plane to be transparent, which is sick. next i should animate the walk cycle, or start getting a ground in.

<p> i am very hungover. this is my first devlog on this project, which i started about a month ago. the first 2-3 weeks were really just me learning webgl and then i took a week break. i've been cleaning my appt. at the same time which i think has been informing my design interests a little.</p>

<p> i've gotten to a point where i'm realizing writing all the low level webgl stuff myself in vanilla js is maybe needlessly sadistic. i finally got a perspective view working, but my sprite is flipped upside down, and i know it has something to do with a quirk of the matrix math but i dont really care anymore.</p>

<p> i was kind of expecting to hit this point. i wish i got a little further, like implementing basic lighting and procgen textures. and i'm still not sure if i can get the visual effect that i want with using an engine/library. but if i can, it would probably make the process more enjoyable. so that's what i'm going to do now: explore some tools
<p> <a href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-2d-vs-3d-library.html">this post</a> from webglfundamentals makes me think i should use threes.js</p>

<p>yeah looks like three.js is the ticket. going to try to do what i want to do with threejs now. i'm a little worried that it wont let me do weird shader stuff... but im sure it has support for that right?</p>
