<p> i am very hungover. this is my first devlog on this project, which i started about a month ago. the first 2-3 weeks were really just me learning webgl and then i took a week break. i've been cleaning my appt. at the same time which i think has been informing my design interests a little.</p>

<p> i've gotten to a point where i'm realizing writing all the low level webgl stuff myself in vanilla js is maybe needlessly sadistic. i finally got a perspective view working, but my sprite is flipped upside down, and i know it has something to do with a quirk of the matrix math but i dont really care anymore.</p>

<p> i was kind of expecting to hit this point. i wish i got a little further, like implementing basic lighting and procgen textures. and i'm still not sure if i can get the visual effect that i want with using an engine/library. but if i can, it would probably make the process more enjoyable. so that's what i'm going to do now: explore some tools
<p> <a href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-2d-vs-3d-library.html">this post</a> from webglfundamentals makes me think i should use threes.js</p>

<p>yeah looks like three.js is the ticket. going to try to do what i want to do with threejs now. i'm a little worried that it wont let me do weird shader stuff... but im sure it has support for that right?</p>
